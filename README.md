# Host plant use by specialist bees
This repository contains data and code for the paper [Regional plant abundance explains patterns of host use by pollen‚Äêspecialist bees in eastern North America](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.4122).

## General organization
To reduce the chance of type I error, we conducted blinded analyses, in which we performed runs of the analyses on simulated or permutated data. We only unblinded the analyses after finalizing all analysis decisions. The folders [field_analysis](https://github.com/cmsmith91/specialist_bees/tree/main/field_analysis) and [inat_analysis](https://github.com/cmsmith91/specialist_bees/tree/main/inat_analysis) contain all blinded analyses. The folder [final_analyses](https://github.com/cmsmith91/specialist_bees/tree/main/final_analyses) contains analyses performed on the real, unblinded data.
